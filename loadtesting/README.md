## Types of load testing

It is possible to distinguish several types of load testing:
- increase
     - one-time
     - zero derivative
     - gradual
     - jumping
     - with fluctuations
- random

### Increase

A general diagram illustrating the increase in the number of requests depending on time during load testing is presented in the figure below:

#### One-time

#### Zero derivative

#### Gradual
